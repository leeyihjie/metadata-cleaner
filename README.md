# Picture Metadata Remover
This Python application aims to help you remove your metadata from your images.

## What is metadata?
The metadata of an image refers to the text information pertaining to an image file that is embedded into the file or saved to a separate file that is associated with the image file.

## Types of image metadata
### Technical metadata
Technical metadata is likely to be automatically generated either by a camera or file source. This includes information like file type, file size, camera settings, date created, and uploader credentials. For example, if the image is a photograph taken by a digital camera, the camera typically generates metadata about the camera and the photo's settings, including aperture, resolution, focal length, shutter speed, ISO speed, camera brand and model, date and time when the image was created, and the GPS location where it was created.

### Descriptive metadata
It is mostly added manually using special software such as GIMP or Affinity Photo. The individual who creates or manages the image can use the software to add or edit the descriptive metadata. The metadata might include the name of the image creator, keywords specific to the image, captions, titles, comments or other information. Effective descriptive metadata can make it easier to search for images.

### Administrative metadata
Administrative metadata is also more subjective based on the information needed to keep images compliant and approved for use. The metadata might include usage and licensing rights, restrictions on reuse, contact information for the image owner or similar types of information.

## Why is removing metadata important?
Metadata can be misused to know about a personâ€™s location or their identity without their knowledge or consent. Therefore, removing metadata is essential to ensuring your privacy and anonymity online.
