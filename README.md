## What is metadata?
The metadata of an image refers to the text information pertaining to an image file that is embedded into the file or saved to a separate file that is associated with the image file.

## Types of image metadata
### Technical metadata
Technical metadata is likely to be automatically generated either by a camera or file source. This includes information like file type, file size, camera settings, date created, and uploader credentials.

### Descriptive metadata
Descriptive metadata will be more subjective based on specific needs. Descriptive metadata fields will allow you to input metadata values that include things like image descriptions, keywords, product line or collection, and the photographerâ€™s name. Descriptive metadata will usually be tailored to people who are searching an image library and will use terms most common to those users. 

### Administrative metadata
Administrative metadata is also more subjective based on the information needed to keep images compliant and approved for use. This typically includes rights management information, restrictions on use, licensing rights, and expiration date.
